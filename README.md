# Robotic Conversational AI Engagement for Cognitive Disorders

As the global population ages, the demand for accessible, scalable tools to support cognitive health and detect early signs of cognitive decline is growing. This project investigates the use of verbal human-robot interaction (HRI) and machine learning analysis of speech data as a potential pathway for cognitive engagement and screening. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), speech technology, and social robotics, the system is designed to function in real-world, home-based settings.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

- Design LLM-powered interactions for verbal human-robot engagement based in the context of an interactive cognitive task (based on clinically validated cognitive tools).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Tasks

### 1. Verbal Interaction

- LLM prompt engineering of interactive cognitive task.
- TTS/STT integration to synthesize robot speech and transcribe user speech for two-way verbal interaction.
